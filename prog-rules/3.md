# LFE Programming Rules and Conventions

## 3 SW Engineering Principles

### 3.1 Export as few functions as possible from a module

### 3.2 Try to reduce intermodule dependencies

### 3.3 Put commonly used code into libraries

### 3.4 Isolate "tricky" or "dirty" code into separate modules

### 3.5 Don't make assumptions about what the caller will do with the results of a function

### 3.6 Abstract out common patterns of code or behavior

### 3.7 Top-down

### 3.8 Don't optimize code

### 3.9 Use the principle of "least astonishment"

### 3.10 Try to eliminate side effects

### 3.11 Don't allow private data structure to "leak" out of a module

### 3.12 Make code as deterministic as possible

### 3.13 Do not program "defensively"

### 3.14 Isolate hardware interfaces with a device driver

### 3.15 Do and undo things in the same function
