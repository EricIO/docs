# Program Development Using LFE - Programming Rules and Conventions

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Abstract

This is a description of programming rules and advise for how to write systems using LFE.

### 1.2 Caveat

This document is a preliminary document and is not complete.

### 1.3 Additional Requirements

The requirements for the use of EBC's "Base System" are not documented here,
but must be followed at a very early design phase if the "Base System" is to
be used. These requirements are documented in 1/10268-AND 10406 Uen "MAP -
Start and Error Recovery".

### 1.4 Purpose

This paper lists some aspects which should be taken into consideration when
specifying and programming software systems using LFE. It does not attempt
to give a complete description of general specification and design activities
which are independent of the use of LFE.

### 1.5 Background and Credits

LFE Programming Rules and Conventions was copied from the
<a href="http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml">Erlang original</a>
and modified for use with LFE programming best practices. All credit to the following:
