### Docs Site Acknowlegements

The <a href="https://github.com/lfe/docs/blob/master/images/logos/LispFlavoredErlang-large.png?raw=true">logo</a>
that the site uses for Lisp Flavored Erlang was originally taken from
one done by an individual who went ny the name  "Starexterminator" in 2009. You can get the original on the
<a href="http://openclipart.org/detail/25974/green-mug-of-tea-by-anonymous-25974">Open
Clip Art Library</a> site.

We made several significant changes to the .svg, including color changes, layer
removals, removing the tea bag and the original logo from the mug. We added the
"Erlang" and the lambda ;-)

The site design itself is one of the Github pages templates, originally created
by <a href="https://twitter.com/michigangraham">Matt Graham</a>. It is the
<a href="http://mattgraham.github.io/Midnight/">Midnight</a> template with
modifications to heading styles, top nav, and font colors. Simply put, the LFE
site provides more green ;-) Thanks, Matt!

## Code from the Wild

Be sure to check out the "Examples" section of the
<a href="/docs.html">Docs</a> page, as we have collected a list of project and
code samples that folks have put up in various corners of Github -- all for
your convenience!
