# 1 Introduction

## 1.7 Setting up a Development Environment

The last thing we need to do before you're off and running is to discuss a
good standard process for setting up a development environment. There are
several key aspects to this:

* Intent
  * exploring LFE and LFE examples
  * creating an LFE library
  * creating an LFE service/daemon/application
  * hacking on LFE itself
* Tools
  * kerl
  * rebar
  * testing
  * IDEs

This section takes a pragmatic approach of getting started as quickly as
possible, so we will not cover these in great detail. However, we will
provide useful links and additional references so that you can explore at your
own leisure.
