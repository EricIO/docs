# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Lisp Flavored Erlang

Lisp Flavored Erlang or LFE is a Lisp syntax front-end to the Erlang
compiler. LFE is a Lisp-2, like Common Lisp, and comes with a REPL (shell).
LFE coexists seamlessly with vanilla Erlang and OTP. As such, code written in
LFE can freely be used together with modules written in vanilla Erlang and
applications in Erlang/OTP.

If you have ever been dissatisfied with the standard Erlang syntax, and you do
not fear the elegance of parentheses (<a href="http://xkcd.com/297/">for a more
civilized age</a>), you might want to spend some time writing code in LFE.

## 1.2 Getting Started

The user guide assumes the following background knowledge:

* basic familiarity with Lisp or Lisp dialects
* a passing knowledge of Erlang
* a working installation of Erlang and LFE

For those that would like additional information on any of these, we recommend
the resources below.

Online:
* The LFE [Quick Start](/quick-start/1.html)
* [Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/content)
  ([.mobi](https://github.com/igstan/learn-you-some-erlang-kindle/downloads))
* [Practical Common Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/)
* [On Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html)
* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/)

Books:
* [Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World](http://pragprog.com/book/jaerlang/programming-erlang)
* [Erlang Programming: A Concurrent Approach to Software Development](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518189.do)
* [Introducing Erlang](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025818.do)
* [Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp](http://norvig.com/paip.html)

The LFE [Quick Start](/quick-start/1.html) is an important
resource, as it covers dependencies, building LFE, installation, using the
REPL, running scripts, and using modules/libraries (OTP and third-party).

## 1.3 More About LFE

### 1.3.1 What LFE Isn't

Just to clear the air and set some expectations, here's what you're *not* going
to find in LFE:

* An implementation of Scheme
* An implementation of Common Lisp
* An implementation of Clojure

As such, you will not find the following:
* A Scheme-like single namespace
* CL packages or munged names faking packages
* Access to Java libraries

### 1.3.2 What LFE Is!

Here's what you *can* expect of LFE:

* A proper Lisp-2, based on the features and limitations of the Erlang VM
* Compatibility with vanilla Erlang and OTP
* It runs on the standard Erlang VM

Furthermore, as a result of Erlang's influence (and LFE's compatibility with
it), the following hold:
* there is no global data
* data is not mutable
* only the standard Erlang data types are used
* you get pattern matching and guards
* you have access to Erlang functions and modules
* LFE has a compiler/interpreter
* functions with declared arity and fixed number of arguments
* Lisp macros

## 1.4 What to Expect from this Guide

The intent of this guide is to follow the same general pattern that the best
Erlang books do, covering the topics listed in the User Guide table of contents
from an LFE perspective.

Some of the Guide's sections will be covered in dedicated tutorials or other
in-depth documents; in those cases, we provide links to that material. If your
favorite topic is not covered above, let us know! We'll try to find a place for
it :-)
