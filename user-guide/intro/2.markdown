# 1 Introduction

## 1.2 The LFE REPL

### 1.2.1 Using the REPL

### 1.2.2 Special Functions

### 1.2.3 Special Commands

### 1.2.4 Getting Out of Trouble

Every once in a while you may find that you do something which causes the REPL
to crash, presenting you with something that looks like this:

    >
      =ERROR REPORT==== 17-Feb-2013::15:39:33 ===
      ...

You don't have to quit and restart the REPL, if you don't want to! There are a
couple of steps that you can take instead.

#### 1.2.4.1 Interrupting a Shell Process

When you get an error as seen above, type ```^g```. This will put you into JCL
(Job Control Language) mode. At the JCL prompt, type ```?``` to see a list of
options:

    User switch command
     --> ?
      c [nn]            - connect to job
      i [nn]            - interrupt job
      k [nn]            - kill job
      j                 - list all jobs
      s [shell]         - start local shell
      r [node [shell]]  - start remote shell
      q        - quit erlang
      ? | h             - this message

Let's see what's running:

    --> j
      1* {lfe_shell,start,[]}

Our shell process is still alive, though not responding. Let's interrupt it and
then connect to it again:

    --> i 1
    --> c 1
    exception error: function_clause
     in (: lists sublist #(error interrupted) 1)
     in (lfe_scan string 4)
     in (lfe_io scan_and_parse 3)

    >

Once we interrupted the job, our error messages were printed to the REPL and we
were placed back at the LFE prompt.

#### 1.2.4.2 Starting a New Shell

Sometimes, though, there is no shell process any more.  Here's how to start up
a new shell process if the one that you're using dies:

    --> s lfe_shell
    --> j
          2* {lfe_shell,start,[]}
    --> c 2
    LFE Shell V5.9.3.1 (abort with ^G)
    >

And you're back up!
