# 2 Diving In

## 2.2 Atoms and Strings

### 2.2.1 Atoms

Atoms are a data type in Erlang that is used to represent non-numerical
constants. In LFE, the typographical limitations of Erlang don't apply, since
they're always quoted in LFE ;-)

Atoms have a value: the same as their text:
{% highlight cl %}
> 'monday
monday
>
{% endhighlight %}
We saw this in the section on Boolean operators with the atoms of ```true```
and ```false```. Since there are no Boolean types in Erlang or LFE, the atoms
```true``` and ```false``` are used instead.

Here are some more examples of atoms:
{% highlight cl %}
> 'Tuesday
Tuesday
> '_Weds
_Weds
> '+
+
> '*
*
> '"and now with spaces"
"and now with spaces"
>
{% endhighlight %}

Though very simple, atoms have a huge impact on our everyday use of Erlang and
LFE, primarily in the area of pattern matching. Hold that thought, though;
we're not quite ready for it yet!
