# 3 Lists and Simple Data

## 3.4 Records

Sometimes lists, tuples, property lists, or hashes are not quite what is
needed. With tuples, you can't name keys (without awkward work-arounds), and
this makes working with large tuples rather cwcumbersome. Records are one way
around this.

A record is a data structure for storing a fixed number of elements. It has
named fields and LFE provides some convenience functions/macros for interacting
with them.

However, it is important to note that record expressions are translated to
tuple expressions during compilation. Due to this, record expressions are not
understood by the shell in both Erlang and LFE. The examples in this section,
therefore, will assume that you are saving the code to a file.

Let's start by defining a record:

{% highlight cl %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cl %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cl %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight cl %}
