# 10 Java Interop


## 10.2 Lisp Flavored Erjang

LFE running on Erjang transforms LFE into a close cousin of Clojure. It's
rather amazing, to be honest. To provide you the opportunity to share in this
amazement, this section of the LFE User Guide Java chapter is dedicated to
Erjang.


### 10.2.1 Introduction

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/krestenkrab">Kresten</a> and
<a href="http://www.trifork.com/">Trifork</a>, the Erlang community has the
option to run many of its libraries and services on the JVM with Erjang.

Key points of Erjang:

* It is a virtual machine for Erlang which runs on Java 7. 
* It loads ``.beam`` files, compiles them to Java ``.class`` files and loads them into the JVM.
* It can boot Erlang/OTP to the Eshell.
* It runs ``mnesia``, with distribution across Erjang/BEAM nodes.

Smaller projects and libraries tend to run quite nicely on Erjang. Larger
systems like RabbitMQ and Riak boot, but still need some work. There is also
on-going work to fully support some of the fringe cases exposed by LFE.


### 10.2.2 Community Resources

Here are some of the Erjang community resources:

* <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/erjang">Mail list/user group</a>
* <a href="http://erjang.org/">Project Site</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/trifork/erjang">Erjang on Github</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/trifork/erjang/wiki">Project wiki pages</a>
* <a href="http://erjang.org/doc">Javadocs</a>


### 10.2.3 Getting Started

As you might expect, we use ``lfetool`` to work with Erjang :-) Here's how you
install it:

```bash
$ lfetool install erjang
```

On a fast internet connection, this should take less than 3 minutes to download Erjang, download Erlang/OTP, and then create the necessary ``.jar`` files.
Once ``lfetool`` has downloaded, compiled, and installed Erjang, you'll be
ready for the next step: hopping into the REPL:

```bash
$ lfetool repl jlfe
LFE Shell V5.10.4 (abort with ^G)
```

```cl
> (* 2 (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6))
42
> (* 2 (lists:foldl (lambda (n acc) (+ n acc)) 0 (lists:seq 1 6)))
42
```

For that to work, you will either need to have ``lfe`` in your path, or be in
an LFE project directory that you created with ``lfetool``.


### 10.2.4 Working with LFE Projects

If you've got an LFE project you have already created and want to see how it
runs on Erjang with jlfe, go ahead and start up the ``jlfe`` REPL in that
project directory -- ``cd`` to your project dir and start the REPL like we did
in the above example.

For those that don't have one, try this out:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lfe/exemplar.git
$ cd exemplar
$ lfetool repl jlfe
LFE Shell V5.10.4 (abort with ^G)
```

Now start up the REPL and call some functions:

```cl
> (slurp '"src/exemplar-html.lfe")
#(ok exemplar-html)
> 
```
