## 8.1 Recursion

In functional languages, recursion plays an important role. For Erlang in
particular, recursion is important because variables can't be changed and
therefor is often very useful take advantage of recursion (examples are given
below).

However, recursion is interesting in and of itself. The roots of functional
programming languages such as Lisp, ML, Erlang, Haskell and others, can
be traced to the concept of recursion in general and the lambda calculus in
particular. Dedekind and Peano seem to be the first to have employed recursion.
Furthermore, Peano gave Bertrand Russell a copy of his "Formulario" which
impacted Russell hugely and quite possibly influenced his efforts on "Principia
Mathematica" which he coauthered several years later. It was from the Principia
that Church derived his lambda notation. Church's student John McCarthy was the
creator of Lisp, and used both the lambda and the concept of recursion in his
new language.

In this section of the user guide, we explore various aspects of recursion as
they can be formulated in LFE.
