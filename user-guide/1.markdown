# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Getting Started

This guide assumes the following:

* basic familiarity with Lisp or Lisp dialects
* passing knowledge of Erlang
* a working installation of Erlang and LFE

For those that would like more background on any of these, we recommend the
following resources:
* TBD
* TBD
* The LFE <a href="http://lfe.github.com/quick-start/1.html">Quick Start</a>

## 1.2 About LFE

### 1.2.1 What LFE Isn't

Just to clear the air and set some expectations, here's what you're *not* going
to find in LFE:

* An implementation of Scheme
* An implementation of Common Lisp
* An implementation of Clojure

As such, you will not find the following:
* A Scheme-like single namespace
* CL packages or munged names faking packages
* Access to Java libraries

### 1.2.2 What LFE Is!

Here's what you *can* expect of LFE:

* A proper Lisp-2, based on the features and limitations of the Erlang VM
* Compatible with vanilla Erlang and OTP
* It runs on the standard Erlang VM

Furthermore, as a result of Erlang's influence (and LFE's compatibility with
it), the following hold:
* there is no global data
* data is not mutable
* only the standard Erlang data types are used
* you get pattern matching and guards
* you have access to Erlang functions and modules
* LFE has a compiler/interpreter
* functions with declared arity and fixed number of arguments
* Lisp macros
