# LFE Style Guide

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Common Lisp Style Guide

For now, we will refer the reader to the
<a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lispguide.xml">Common
Lisp Style Guide</a>.

In the future, we hope to port the parts of this that apply to LFE and
Erlang/OTP. At that time, this page will serve as the introduction to the
ported material.

### 1.2 See Also

Also be sure to read the guide <a href="/prog-rules/1.html">LFE Programming
Rules and Conventions</a>.
