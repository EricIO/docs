# Tutorial: Mnesia

## 3 Structure

### 3.1 Digging in Deeper

We've had a quick taste of Mnesia, and what some of the calls look like in LFE.
Next we're going to tackle a bit more heady stuff: tables and relationships.

Go ahead and re-start the REPL, using a different database name this time:

```bash
$ DB=./Company.DB make mnesia-shell
```

```cl
> (: mnesia create_schema (list (node)))
ok
> (: mnesia start)
ok
>
```

```cl
> (slurp '"src/structure.lfe")
#(ok structure)
>
```
