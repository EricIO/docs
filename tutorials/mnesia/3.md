# Tutorial: Mnesia

## 3 Structure

### 3.1 Digging in Deeper

We've had a quick taste of Mnesia, and what some of the calls look like in LFE.
Next we're going to tackle a bit more heady stuff: tables and relationships.

Go ahead and re-start the REPL, using a different database name this time:

```bash
$ DB=./Company.DB make mnesia-shell
```

```cl
> (mnesia:create_schema (list (node)))
ok
> (mnesia:start)
ok
>
```

Then pull in the code that will let us define our tables, adding them to the
Mnesia schema we just created:

```cl
> (slurp '"src/structure.lfe")
#(ok structure)
>
```

The ``structure`` module includes LFE records that act as our table definitions,
as well as a macro that lets us create Mnesia tables with almost no boilerplate.

The following records are defined in ``include/tables.lfe``:

```cl
(defrecord employee
  id
  name
  salary
  gender
  phone
  room-number)

(defrecord department
  id
  name)

(defrecord project
  name
  number)

(defrecord manager
  employee-id
  department-id)

(defrecord in-department
  employee-id
  department-id)

(defrecord in-project
  employee-id
  project-name)
```
