# Tutorial: Mnesia

## 3 Structure

### 3.1 Starting Again

We've had a quick taste of Mnesia, and what some of the calls look like in LFE.
Next we're going to tackle a bit more heady stuff: tables and relationships.

Go ahead and re-start the REPL, using a different database name this time:

```bash
$ DB=./Company.DB make mnesia-shell
```

```cl
> (mnesia:create_schema (list (node)))
ok
> (mnesia:start)
ok
>
```

Then pull in the code that will let us define our tables, adding them to the
Mnesia schema we just created:

```cl
> (slurp '"src/structure.lfe")
#(ok structure)
>
```

### 3.2 Records as Tables

The ``structure`` module includes LFE records that act as our table definitions,
as well as a macro that lets us create Mnesia tables with almost no boilerplate.

The following records are defined in ``include/tables.lfe``:

```cl
(defrecord employee
  id
  name
  salary
  gender
  phone
  room-number)

(defrecord department
  id
  name)

(defrecord project
  name
  number)

(defrecord manager
  employee-id
  department-id)

(defrecord in-department
  employee-id
  department-id)

(defrecord in-project
  employee-id
  project-name)
```

These records (tables) are taken from the example given in the
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/Mnesia_chap2.html#id63101">Erlang
 Mnesia tutorial</a> which also gives this entity diagram for their proposed
 "Company" database:

In the ``src/structure.lfe`` module which we have just imported, some utility
functions are defined which will lets us easily create tables in Mnesia based
on the records defined in the ``include/tables.lfe`` file. Of particular
interest right now is the ``(init)`` function; let's call it:

### 3.3 Creating Our Tables

```cl
  > (init)
  (#(create-set-tables (#(atomic ok) #(atomic ok) #(atomic ok) #(atomic ok)))
   #(create-bag-tables (#(atomic ok) #(atomic ok))))
  >
```

This just created all our Mnesia tables for us. If we run it again, we'll see
errors indicating that the tables have already been created:

```cl
  > (init)
  (#(create-set-tables
     (#(aborted #(already_exists employee))
      #(aborted #(already_exists department))
      #(aborted #(already_exists project))
      #(aborted #(already_exists manager))))
   #(create-bag-tables
     (#(aborted #(already_exists in-department))
      #(aborted #(already_exists in-project)))))
  >
```
Let's re-run that ``info`` function:

```cl
    (mnesia:info)
```

If you're interested in see the details of any given table, you can check each
out with the following:

```cl
  > (mnesia:table_info 'employee 'all)
  (#(access_mode read_write)
   #(active_replicas (nonode@nohost))
   #(all_nodes (nonode@nohost))
   #(arity 7)
   #(attributes (id name salary gender phone room-number))
   #(checkpoints ())
   #(commit_work ())
   #(cookie #(#(1396 680215 616649) nonode@nohost))
   #(cstruct
     #(cstruct
       employee
       set
       (nonode@nohost)
       ()
       ()
       0
       read_write
       false
       ()
       ()
       false
       employee
       (id name salary gender ...)
       ()
       ()
       ()
       #(...)...))
   #(disc_copies ())
   #(disc_only_copies ())
   #(frag_properties ())
   #(index ())
   #(load_by_force false)
   #(load_node nonode@nohost)
   #(load_order 0)
   #(load_reason #(dumper create_table))
   #(local_content false)
   #(majority false)
   #(master_nodes ())
   #(memory 317)
   #(ram_copies (nonode@nohost))
   #(record_name employee)
   #(record_validation #(employee 7 set))
   #(type set)
   #(size 0)
   #(snmp ())
   #(storage_properties ...)
   #(...)...)
  >
```

We can use the same function to pull out certain data. For instance, here's how
to find what backend type is being used for any given table:

```cl
  > (mnesia:table_info 'employee 'type)
  set
  > (mnesia:table_info 'in-project 'type)
  bag
  >
```
