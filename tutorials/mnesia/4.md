### 4.1 Inserting Data

We've created tables and we know how to inspect their metadata; now let's give
them *data*. Again, from the REPL, we'll pull in our source code:

```cl
> (slurp '"src/content.lfe")
#(ok content)
>
```

### 4.1.1 Inserting Department Data

We'll start by inserting a few departments One of the functions now available
to us in the REPL is ``insert-departments``. It is defined like so:

```cl
(defun insert-departments
  (('())
   'ok)
  (((cons (list id name) tail))
   (let ((department (make-department id id name name)))
     (mnesia:transaction (lambda () (mnesia:write department)))
     (insert-departments tail))))
```

Which means that we can create a simple list of lists that it will iterate
over and insert for us. Let's try it. Here's our list of departments:

```cl

> (set depts '((B/SF "Open Telecom Platform")
               (B/SFP "OTP - Product Development")
               (B/SFR "Computer Science Laboratory")))
>
```

Let's do the insert:

```cl
> (insert-departments depts)
ok
```

To make sure that everything is where we planned, we can use ``mnesia:foldl``:

```cl
> (mnesia:transaction
    (lambda ()
      (mnesia:foldl (lambda (x _) (lfe_io:format '"~p~n" (list x)))
                    0
                    'department)))
#(department B/SFP "OTP - Product Development")
#(department B/SFR "Computer Science Laboratory")
#(department B/SF "Open Telecom Platform")
#(atomic ok)
>
```

We've defined this as a function you can fall from now on, without all that
typing:

```cl
(mnesia-tutorial-util:show-data 'department)
#(department B/SFP "OTP - Product Development")
#(department B/SFR "Computer Science Laboratory")
#(department B/SF "Open Telecom Platform")
#(atomic ok)
>
```

### 4.1.2 Inserting Project Data

We can do something similar for populating our project table. There is another
utility function defined for inserting projects, just like the one above for
our company's departments:

```cl
> (set projs '((erlang 1)
               (otp 2)
               (beam 3)
               (mnesia 5)
               (wolf 6)
               (documentation 7)
               (www 8))))
> (insert-projects projs)
ok
```

Let's give this a check, too:

```cl
(mnesia-tutorial-util:show-data 'project)
#(project erlang 1)
#(project wolf 6)
#(project www 8)
#(project otp 2)
#(project mnesia 5)
#(project beam 3)
#(project documentation 7)
#(atomic ok)
>
```

We've inserted all the data we can that doesn't depend upon relationships.
All the remainder or our data will require dependent insertions.

### 4.2 Building Relationships

We've going to take advantage of another utility function for setting up
relationships between employees and their departments and projects:

```cl
(defun insert-employee(employee department-id project-names)
  (mnesia:transaction
    (lambda ()
      (mnesia:write employee)
      (insert-department-relation (employee-id employee) department-id)
      (insert-project-relations (employee-id employee) project-names))))
```

The functions called by our function are available for your viewing pleasure
in the
<a href="https://github.com/lfe/mnesia-tutorial/blob/master/src/content.lfe">LFE
Mnesia tutorial repo</a>. They are similar in nature to the other utility
functions we have already defined.

Let's define our first employee (we will referr to the employee record we
defined, while doing so):

```cl
> (set emp (make-employee
    id 104732
    name '"klacke"
    salary 7
    gender 'M
    phone 98108
    room-number #(221 015)))
#(employee 104732 "klacke" 7 M 98108 #(221 15))
```

Now let's use our insert utility function:

```cl
> (insert-employee emp 'B/SFR '(erlang mnesia otp))
#(atomic ok)
```

We've got three tables to check; let's do that all at once:

```cl
> (mnesia-tutorial-util:show-data 'employee)
#(employee 104732 "klacke" 7 M 98108 #(221 15))
#(atomic ok)
> (mnesia-tutorial-util:show-data 'in-project)
#(in-project 104732 erlang)
#(in-project 104732 mnesia)
#(in-project 104732 otp)
#(atomic ok)
> (mnesia-tutorial-util:show-data 'in-department)
#(in-department 104732 B/SFR)
#(atomic ok)
>
```

Fantastic! It's all there :-)

Let's add some more:

```cl

```

### 4.3 Adding the Missing Data

There are a last few bits of data we can now add, given that we've got our
employee data fully inserted now: manager data.

```cl
```
