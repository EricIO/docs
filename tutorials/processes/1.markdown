# Tutorial: Lightweight Processes

Due to it's Erlang foundation, an LFE program is composed of anything from 1 to
hundreds of thousands of lightweight processes.  In fact, a
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.functional/5kldn1QJ73c">2005 message</a>
to
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/comp.lang.functional">comp.lang.functional</a>
reported spawning 20 million messages in a ring benchmark (on a 1.5 GHz SPARC
with 16 GB RAM).

This is possible in part because each process operates independently with its
own private memory, communicating via message passing, and the overhead for an
Erlang process is pretty low (~1.5k for 32-bit and ~2.7k for 64-bit; see the
Efficiency Guide's section on
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/processes.html">processes</a>
for more info).

This tutorial aims to decrease the mystery around Erlang processes and how to
use them in LFE programs.
